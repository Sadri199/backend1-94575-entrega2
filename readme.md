# Backend 1 - Final Project

A simple backend application built with **Node.js**, **Express** and **Socket Io** for Coderhouse's course.
This project serves as a boilerplate for building RESTful APIs, it has 2 routes, one for Products and one for Carts; Products has full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and Carts only has Create and Read (partially).
Now it also has better routing (except for Socket IO), it serves HTML and it can even manipulate the DOM in real time.
It uses a **MongoDB** to store the information.

## 🧾 Comments

- `/db` has 2 the jsons that are part of the legacy code, right now it's only there for the "realTime" page.

- `Backend 1 Entrega.postman_collection.json` is the Postman Collection with all the different requests. I don't know why i'm adding this but hey, it's free.

- I tried my best to understand how Handlebars could make Queries to MongoDB work but I couldn't find a way so no "cart" page.
