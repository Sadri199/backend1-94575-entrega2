# Backend 1 - Final Project (EDIT)

A simple backend application built with **Node.js**, **Express** and **Socket Io** for Coderhouse's course.
This project serves as a boilerplate for building RESTful APIs, it has 2 routes, one for Products and one for Carts; Products has full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and Carts only has Create and Read (partially).
Now it also has better routing (except for Socket IO), it serves HTML and it can even manipulate the DOM in real time.

## 🧾 Comments

- `/db` has 2 the jsons with preloaded data.

- `Backend 1 Entrega.postman_collection.json` is the Postman Collection with all the different requests. I don't know why i'm adding this but hey, it's free.

- I couldn't find a way to modularize Socket IO. It should work in "realTime.controller.js" but it doesn't.
